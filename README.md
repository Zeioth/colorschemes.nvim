# colorschemes.nvim
My curated collection of Neovim colorschemes

## Why
The purpose of having a curated colorschemes repository is to make easy to preview them on telescope with `require("telescope.builtin").colorscheme`.

## How to use
* Copy `colorschemes.lua` into your lazy plugins directory.
* Inside Neovim run the command `:lua require("telescope.builtin").colorscheme` and preview the plugins.
* Press enter to confim.
